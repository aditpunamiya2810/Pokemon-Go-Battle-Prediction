**Pokemon Go Battle Prediction**
A machine learning project that uses `RandomForestClassifier` to predict which pokemon will win based on raw statistics of a Pokemon and also data of previous battles

We have not done hyper paramater tuning as of now because we are getting optimal results however if the data changes in the future, we might have to retrain it.
For the current model we are getting an accuracy of 95% which is good from a perspective of a college project.

We have also built a web app using `Streamlit` for an interactive interface and used `pokeapi` to give us images of the Pokemon who is likely to win between the two.
